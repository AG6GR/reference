Electric Imp Reference Library
==============================
The Electric Imp Reference Library contains classes to help you interface with external hardware, webservices, and accomplish a myriad of tasks!

We have split the Reference Library into 3 categories:

- [Agent](/tree/master/agent) - Agent libraries to simplify tasks such as persistant storage, building APIs, etc
- [Hardware](/tree/master/hardware) - Device libraries to simplify interfacing with external hardware, managing your wifi connection, etc
- [Web Services](/tree/master/webservices) - Agent libraries that wrap external APIs such as Twitter, Xively, etc
