ExampleLibrary
==============
ExampleLibrary is not a real Electric Imp library, it demonstrates the proper structure and coding style you should use when you contribute to the Electic Imp Reference Library.

This section of the README file should be replaced with a description of what your class does.

Contributors
============
This section of the README file should include a list of contributors, with any contact information they wish to provide:

- [Matt Haines](https://twitter.com/beardedinventor)

Usage
=====
This section of the README file should include sample usage (ie - how to create the class, call common methods, etc):

```
// Instantiate class
example <- ExampleLibrary();

// Call a particular method:
example.DoAThing();
```
