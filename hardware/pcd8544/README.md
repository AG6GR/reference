PCD8544 LCD Driver
======

Class for using an LCD with a PCD8544 driver chip with the Imp.

The screen used to test this class was a "Nokia 5110" monochrome LCD that can be purchased from Adafruit:

This class, by itself, can display a text string using a built-in font. It can be combined with agent code to enable display of black & white bitmap images (or any pixel data, really, as long as you format it properly.)
For examples (such as web-based text input and image display) visit https://github.com/electricimp/examples/pcd8544/
