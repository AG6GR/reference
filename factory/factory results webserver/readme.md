Factory Agent Webserver Example
======

With this example a DUT can post JSON to a url webhook that will relay it the agent webserver.
On the factory floor a computer with internet access will go to the root page of the agent server. When the DUT posts test results (JSON data) it will automatically appear in a table on the page.
